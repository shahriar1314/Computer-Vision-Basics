## Computer-Vision-Basics

This repository includes a collection of basic computer vision algorithms and their practical applications. It features implementations of key techniques such as homography, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and RANSAC, along with examples demonstrating how these methods are applied in real-world scenarios. The goal of this repository is to provide a hands-on understanding of foundational computer vision concepts and to serve as a reference for those exploring image processing and feature matching.
